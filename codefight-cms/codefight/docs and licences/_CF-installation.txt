Create a database and run the installation wizard. If installer doesn't work for you there is a latest sql file at install/file which you can import manually.



STEP 2[if not using installer]:
=================================
edit config file at
app/config/config.php
and look around line 14 and set the base_url



STEP 3[if not using installer]:
======================================
edit database settings at
app/config/database.php



STEP 5[optional]:
====================
open .htaccess and change RewriteBase / with your base folder location and remove hash.
